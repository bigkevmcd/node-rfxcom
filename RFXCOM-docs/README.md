RFXCOM Device Protocol API Documentation
========================================

The RFXCOM device protocol is proprietary to RFXCOM, and its use is documented in the 'RFXtrx Software
Development Kit' which is available to *bona-fide* purchasers of the RFXtrx433E or other RFXCOM products
on application to RFXCOM, via their [web site](http://www.rfxcom.com/) or by [email](mailto:support@rfxcom.com).
The terms under which this SDK is supplied prohibit its disclosure or distribution without authorisation, and
accordingly it is not being made available here.

The SDK comprises detailed documentation, example source code and a C language header file that may be incorporated
directly in end-user software, if appropriate. The source code and header files include a copyright notice which
claims ownership of the code and reserves all rights to RFXCOM, but licenses the C header file to be used in 'open source'
software so long as the copyright notice is included. The **node-rfxcom** package, being implemented entirely
in Javascript, makes no use of the C language header file and does not contain any other RFXCOM-owned software.

The RFXCOM products are under active development, with support for new devices and protocols being added on a regular
basis, in addition to bug fixes. The SDK is updated from time to time, and the updated versions may be obtained from
RFXCOM.
